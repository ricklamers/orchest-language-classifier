[![Open in Orchest](https://github.com/orchest/orchest-examples/raw/main/imgs/open_in_orchest.svg)](https://cloud.orchest.io/?import_url=https://github.com/ricklamers/orchest-language-classifier/)

This pipeline classifies random text paragraphs found on websites linked to from random Wikipedia pages.

It's a proof of concept project that shows how you can add services to Orchest to improve the monitoring of pipelines while they're executing using a Streamlit application.
